    excerpt:
      "Why traffic suddenly stops on an empty highway, the math behind the wave, and why routing-around can't solve a problem that's caused by routing-around.",
    body: `You're driving 70 mph. Suddenly brake lights. You stop. Thirty seconds later you're moving again, and there's no obstruction in sight.

That's a phantom traffic jam. It is not caused by an accident or a bottleneck. It is caused by one driver tapping the brake a little too hard, and the wave propagating backward through the chain of following vehicles. Each driver brakes slightly more than the one in front, until somewhere upstream, traffic stops.

The math is well-understood. The Treiber-Helbing model and its successors describe traffic as a fluid with drivers as molecules. Stability depends on the response gain, meaning how aggressively each driver corrects to maintain a safe gap. When that gain crosses a threshold, the system goes unstable.

Apps like Waze and Google Maps don't address this. They route you around an existing wave, which paradoxically can intensify the wave by adding traffic to the workaround route. Cruze takes a different approach: rather than route around the wave, we change the inputs that create it. Coordinated speed adjustments across the swarm dampen the response gain below the instability threshold. The wave never forms.`,

    title: "The hidden cost of stop-and-go: a fleet ops deep dive",
    author: "Cruze Research",
    publishedAt: "2026-04-08",
    excerpt:
      "Per-truck, per-route, per-shift: where does the fuel actually go in stop-and-go traffic, and what's the real margin on a swarm-routing intervention?",
    body: `For a Class 8 tractor at highway speeds, brake-then-accelerate cycles can consume 4-7x the fuel-per-mile of steady-state cruise. Multiply that across a 600-truck fleet running 80,000 miles per truck per year, and the variance in routes from "smooth" to "congested" represents 8-figure annual swings in fuel spend.

The marginal-returns curve is non-linear. The first 5% of stop-and-go reduction recovers 6 to 8% of fuel. The next 5% recovers another 3 to 5%. After that, the curve flattens, because pure swarm coordination cannot fully eliminate congestion when demand exceeds capacity.

The implication: pilot in the right places. Cruze prioritizes corridors where measured stop-and-go intensity is in the steepest part of the curve. We share the calibration before pilot start so fleet ops know what to expect.`,
