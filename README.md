# Cruze: Dissolve Traffic, Not Just Avoid It

**Cruze transforms every smartphone into an active traffic actuator.**

While traditional navigation apps simply route you around traffic, Cruze uses swarm intelligence and physics-informed AI to actively coordinate driver speeds and eliminate phantom jams before they form.

## The Mission
Phantom traffic jams—stop-and-go waves caused by minor braking events—account for huge amounts of wasted fuel, lost time, and accidents. Cruze tackles this problem at the source.

## How It Works
Cruze isn't just a map; it's a co-pilot for the collective road.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Coordinates subtle speed adjustments across multiple drivers to smooth out traffic flow.
- **Physics-Informed AI**: Predicts and neutralizes traffic waves using advanced fluid dynamics models.
- **Eco-Driving**: Optimizing flow means less braking and acceleration, significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

## Key Benefits
- **Save Time**: Reach your destination faster by preventing the jam capabilities.
- **Save Fuel**: Smoother driving means better mileage and lower costs.
- **Save Lives**: Reducing sudden stops decreases the risk of rear-end collisions.
